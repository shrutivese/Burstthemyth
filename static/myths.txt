Accessibility only affects a few people | Accessibility affects many people in a variety of ways, as it not only benefits individuals with disabilities but also older adults, individuals with situational impairments, and those with temporary disabilities.
People with disabilities will not use websites | Many people with disabilities use websites regularly, and accessible websites enable them to access information, services, and products independently.
Making websites accessible is costly and time-consuming | While implementing accessibility may require initial investment, many accessibility improvements are cost-effective and can actually improve overall website usability for all users.
Making websites accessible is only about adding alt text to images | Accessibility encompasses a wide range of considerations beyond alt text, including keyboard navigation, color contrast, semantic HTML, and more.
Web accessibility is just the developer's responsibility | Accessibility is a shared responsibility among designers, developers, content creators, and testers throughout the entire development process.
Accessibility only helps people with disabilities | Accessibility benefits everyone, including older adults, individuals with low literacy or limited English proficiency, users on mobile devices, and even temporary situations like a broken arm.
Making websites accessible does not bring any additional benefits | Accessible websites often see improved usability, better search engine optimization (SEO), increased audience reach, and reduced legal risks.
Accessibility can be fixed by the accessibility overlay | Accessibility overlays may provide quick fixes but often introduce new accessibility issues and do not address the root causes of accessibility barriers.
Using automated tools is all I need to do to make my website accessible | Automated tools are helpful but cannot catch all accessibility issues, and manual testing by individuals with disabilities is crucial for comprehensive accessibility evaluation.
Accessibility is only for blind users | Accessibility addresses a wide range of disabilities, including auditory, cognitive, physical, and speech-related disabilities, in addition to visual impairments.
Accessibility is optional | Accessibility is a legal requirement in many countries and aligns with ethical and inclusive design principles.
Accessibility is only about preventing lawsuits | While legal compliance is important, accessibility also fosters inclusivity, diversity, and equal access to information and services.
Accessibility is only about following the WCAG | While the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide valuable standards, accessibility goes beyond guidelines to ensure a truly inclusive user experience.
Accessibility can be achieved by only adding ARIA attributes | ARIA attributes are a helpful tool, but accessibility requires a holistic approach that includes proper HTML structure, semantics, and user interface design.
We don't need to be compliant | Striving for accessibility compliance is essential for ensuring equal access to digital content and services for all users.
Only accessibility experts can implement accessibility fixes | While accessibility experts provide valuable expertise, everyone involved in the development process can contribute to creating accessible experiences through education and collaboration.
Accessibility is like a feature - you do it once and then you have it | Accessibility is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement to ensure that digital content remains accessible as technologies and user needs evolve.
Accessibility can be fixed by providing a separate website version for disabled people | Creating separate versions can lead to segregation and unequal access. It's more effective to integrate accessibility into the main website to ensure inclusivity for all users.
People with disabilities don't use the web | Many people with disabilities use the web daily for communication, education, employment, entertainment, and more.
Blind people don't watch movies | Blind and visually impaired individuals can enjoy movies through audio descriptions, accessible interfaces, and inclusive design practices.
Accessibility can only be tested by disabled people | While testing by individuals with disabilities is invaluable, accessibility testing can and should be conducted by a diverse team that includes people with disabilities as well as experts and users representing various perspectives and abilities.
